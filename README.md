# text-colors.css
The ultimate text color theme file with just about every colorscheme you can imagine. Note: PurgeCSS is recommended.

## Installation

1. Download `all-colors.css`
2. Put it in your project
3. Add this style tag to your head: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="all-colors.css">`

## Usage

Whenever you need a color, just, you know, use the class for that color:

For example, you use #FE44A1 in your specific theme, just use this:

```html
<p class="text-color-FE44A1">Some text</p>
```

## Why?

Because some people hate using inline styling, so I spent about 100 hours compiling this css file for those people.

## Contributing

There is nothing to contribute, but make a PR if you think this can be improved.

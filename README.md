# text-colors.css
The ultimate text color theme file with just about every colorscheme you can imagine. Note: PurgeCSS is a must.

## Installation

1. Download `text-colors.min.css` 
2. Put it in your project
3. Add this style tag to your head: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/text-colors.min.css">`
4. Recommended: install PurgeCSS to sanitize the file to remove unneeded classes.

## Usage

Whenever you need a color, just, you know, use the class for that color:

For example, you use #FE44 A1 in your specific theme, just use this:

```html
<p class="tc-FE44A1">Some text</p>
```

## Why?

Because some people hate using inline styling, so I spent about 100 hours compiling this css file for those people. It's **only ~435MB**!

## No CDN?

This will never be on any CDN.

## Contributing

There is nothing to contribute, but make a PR if you think this can be improved.

### Actually?

No, do not actually use this, unless you want to drain users of they precious data. If however you do use it, use PurgeCSS to remove the classes you are not using.
